## Machine Learning Setup

The DentalAI app supports both ML-based detection and computer vision fallback. See [docs/ML_MODEL_SETUP.md](docs/ML_MODEL_SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### Detection Methods
- **YOLO Detection**: Uses YOLOv5/YOLOv8 models converted to CoreML for high-accuracy detection
- **CV Detection**: Uses computer vision algorithms as a fallback
- **Automatic Fallback**: Seamlessly switches between methods based on availability

### Model Requirements
- **Format**: `.mlpackage` (CoreML package format)
- **Input**: RGB image (224x224 or 416x416 recommended)
- **Output**: Detection results with bounding boxes and confidence scores
- **Framework**: CoreML with Vision framework integration

### Quick Setup
1. **Prepare Real Data**: Organize dental images in YOLO format
2. **Train YOLO Model**: Use `scripts/train_yolo_model.py` with real dental data
3. **Convert to CoreML**: Use `scripts/convert_yolo_model.py` to convert `.pt` to `.mlpackage`
4. **Add Model**: Place your `.mlpackage` file in `DentalAI/Resources/Models/`
5. **Update Name**: Set model name in `MLDetectionService.swift`
6. **Configure Flags**: Use `FeatureFlags` to control detection method
7. **Test**: Run the app to verify detection works

### Feature Flags
```swift
// Enable ML detection (default)
FeatureFlags.useMLDetection = true

// Enable CV detection as fallback
FeatureFlags.useCVDetection = true

// Enable automatic fallback
FeatureFlags.enableFallback = true
```

### Privacy & Security
- **On-device Processing**: All ML inference happens locally
- **No Data Transmission**: Images never leave the device
- **Model Security**: Models are included in app bundle
- **User Control**: Full control over detection preferences

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Enhanced ML Models**: Improved accuracy and speed
- **Professional Integration**: Dentist referral network
- **Tele-dentistry**: Remote consultation capabilities
- **Insurance Integration**: Coverage verification
- **Advanced Analytics**: Predictive health insights

### Technical Improvements
