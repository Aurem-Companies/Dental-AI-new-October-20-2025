# Sample Test Image Placeholder

## Instructions:
1. Add a sample teeth image file named `sample_teeth.jpg` to this directory
2. Ensure the file is added to the **DentalAI app target** (not tests)
3. The image should show teeth/dental features for testing detection

## File Requirements:
- **Name**: `sample_teeth.jpg`
- **Format**: JPEG
- **Content**: Image showing teeth/dental features
- **Target**: DentalAI app target (not test target)
- **Location**: `DentalAI/Resources/TestAssets/sample_teeth.jpg`

## Usage:
The SmokeTest.swift utility will load this image and run it through the detection pipeline to verify the app is functional.

## Note:
This is a placeholder file. Replace it with the actual sample image file.
